			<p>We would like to share with you the following information.</p>
<p>A small primary school in Bethangere Village of Bidadi Hobli, Ramanagar district has around thirty students. The head mistress of the school requested us to provide books, pencils, erasers and sharpeners to the poor students. Accordingly we have distributed about 150 numbers of the above. The students, staff and management of the school were very happy about it.</p>
<p>A Kannada medium Sahakari Vidya Niketan Padmanabhanagar, Bangalore with about 700 students was in need of sports materials. They have a good play ground nearby and talented students, but did not have sufficient sports materials. On their request sports materials ranging from Volley ball, Badminton Rackets, Shuttle cocks, Cricket set were donated to the school for the use of the students.</p>
<p>In fact donors may also donate the above materials, either new or partly used to the needy schools.</p>
<p>Thank you. We shall keep you posted about our activities.</p>

			<h1>“Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains”</h1>
<pre>- Jean Jacques Rousseau (Opening line of Social Contract published in 1762)

</pre>
<p>This statement has stood the test of time for over two centuries now. A cursory understanding of Modern society today reveals these deep inequalities in every sphere of life, from the basic necessities of life like education , health-care, housing, gainful employment and other peripheral functions of the society like culture, entertainment and sports. This entrenched inequality stems mainly from the economic background of men. And the goal of our foundation is to take a small step to bridge this inequality in the area of opportunity and access to quality education. The Constitution of India promises to enact and enable actions towards Equality of Status and Opportunity . However ,today’s India paints a very different picture.Post-1992 progress and prosperity has largely been limited to swathes of the urban middle classes , and the much-bandied and promised trickle down effect is yet to be witnessed.</p>
<p>Educational institutions today have been money making ventures , and are run very much on the lines of a Corporate organization with the relentless pursuit of profit. Government policy towards Education is evident from the fact that Public spending on Education is still limited to around 3% of the GDP ( Recent budgets have even shown a decrease in terms of percentage of GDP) . On one hand we have private educational institutions who charge astronomical fees, back-ground check the economic stability of parents with profiteering as the primary driver. Most of the private educational institutions are shamelessly exclusive in their policy.On the other hand we have Government apathy towards education directly translates to poor quality of education and high drop out rates in Government run schools.</p>
<p>Health care in India is in a worse situation , public expenditure on Health amounted to only 1.45 percent of the GDP. Infant mortality rates and Maternal mortality ratios remain high and are comparable to countries in sub-saharan Africa. Private healthcare in India is only slightly better , with some successful private initiatives to reach and help the poor gain access to quality healthcare. Most private institutions (as is their credo) are focussed on the insured middle classes with an eye on their balance sheets. There is much to be done to ensure quality healthcare to all.</p>
<p>The poorer class of the country are stuck with little or no alternative except to manfully continue with the cruel drudgery of their lives , without a respite in sight. The unorganized labor force plow on with their lives with no hopes of a retirement or even a whiff of the benefits which the salaried middle classes take for granted (a steady job, Provident fund, Superannuation, retirement funds ,Health insurance etc).</p>
<p>For most times , theirs is an untold story as well. The mainstream media of today is driven by market economics to such an extent , that news content only focusses on issues relevant to big business and the middle classes. Most of the media houses today are listed on the stock exchanges , and are owned largely by big business houses. They are run in the same manner as a corporate body with the profits as the primary objective. In doing so , the objectivity and the depth of the news being reported has clearly been lost to a great degree.A cursory surfing of the TV news channels would clearly bear out this point , where news is being localized and driven by the market audience at the great cost of relevance.</p>
<p>A great man once remarked that ‘Poverty is the worst form of violence’. If we were to give credence to this statement , the necessary corollary to this statement would mean that the Indian Government is the worst offender on the planet and the affluent classes of the nation willing and wilful accomplices in the crime. None other than the father of our nation made the remark.He would have died many a death on witnessing the current state of affairs in our Nation of today.</p>
<p>The point we wish to make here is that the poor classes of the country are getting further marginalized (in every sphere of life and public consciousness) and are wedged and forced to lead a life of poverty between an apathetic government , market-driven mass media and the affluent middle classes.</p>
<p>Education can play a vital role in transforming the society to a more equitable and balanced state. All the basic necessities in life follow (and originate) with good education and access to quality health-care.</p>
<p>So with modest beginnings and best intentions we have set our primary focus in the field of Education.We are a group of like minded individuals who have formed this trust with the following objectives –</p>
<ol><li>Enable children from the poorer classes to enjoy the benefits of quality education.</li>
<li>Help children from the poorer classes gain access to quality health-care.</li>
<li>Devote time ,money and personal interest in the progress of the child.</li>
