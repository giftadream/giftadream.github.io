			<p>The academic year 2014–15 has come to a close and we are happy to place before you the performance highlights of the Gift a Dream Foundation (GADF).</p>
<p><b>Table 1 – An update on the Foundation’s activities in the recent years</b></p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Year</b></td>

</tr></tbody></table><p>From the above facts and figures, it can be seen that the Foundation which has made a small and humble beginning in the year 2010–11, has now grown manifolds and intends to extend its helping the needy in a much larger way in the years ahead. We are highly indebted to the whole hearted donations received from a cross section of people, who are instrumental in promoting education. The Foundation acknowledges with gratitude the main pillar of our activities, Sri Kabir Bhandary, who has been supporting the activities of the Foundation, since 2011, without which we would not have reached this position today.</p>
<p>The break-up of children who are benefitted from the Foundation, during the year category–wise, are as under:</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>The students are benefitted from the Foundation, have performed well in their respective examinations and we are happy to share the news that one of our girl students who got the opportunity of continuing her education because of the help extended by the Foundation, has got selected in the campus interviews and thus, the Foundation feels itself proud of having supported the case of education of girl child, which is one of the main motto of the Foundation.</p>
<p>Apart from this we have supported 40 government schools and 3  government PU colleges in Bangalore City, Districts of Bangalore Rural, Chikkaballapur, Chamarajanagar (2 tribal schools) and Madhugiri taluk of Tumkur District, most of them remotely situated and inaccessible.</p>
<p>We have supplied the above institutions with library books, both reference and text books – in case of colleges and reference and story books in schools, used/new computers, sports materials, band sets, kitchen appliances including plates and glasses, uniforms and footwear items, study material like charts, models, scientific material and educational toys for some anganawadi centres. We have also supplied laboratory materials for students of the Training centre for the deaf – which trains students in ITI, both for fitter, lathe work and electronics subjects.</p>
<p>We thank our donors and volunteers for having enabled us to do all the above by contributing funds and their time.  We thank each and every one of them for donating towards the education of under privileged students from remote villages</p>
<p>We could not conduct the annual get together and we propose to hold the same during June – July 2015, not only to present the achievements of the Foundation, but also to draw a road show for the year ahead.</p>
<p>We would like to further place on record the services of our volunteers who continue to teach the students of Vinayaka School in English, Science, Mathematics and humanities thrice a week. They have become very popular and the students just love them.</p>
<p>Our printer continues to supply us the printed matter be it vouchers, letterheads or applications, free of cost. Thanks to him.</p>
<p>All our vendors give us good discounts considering the cause involved. The proprietor of a book store at Gandhi Bazaar gave us many unsold toys free of cost.</p>
<p>The trustees will continue to contribute towards the administrative costs of the trust this year as well.</p>
<p>We once again thank the entire team of donors, volunteers, well wishers, dedicated and concerned teachers, principals and heads of institutions who have contributed positively towards this cause and the smiles of the children when they receive books, geometry boxes etc more than compensate for all our work.</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU ALL ONCE AGAIN.       </strong></p>
