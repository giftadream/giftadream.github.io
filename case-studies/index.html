			<p>Kanaka (name changed) was a single mother who had to support her daughter Vidya (name changed) and herself with her meagre income. Then Aarthi came forward tohelp her daughter who was then in the second standard. Now Vidya is in eight standard and is consistently faring well in studies. Aarthi has committed sponsoring herself to Vidya’s continued education with whatever course she chooses to take.</p>
<p>Ranjitha (name changed) a student of IX standard is good in studies, but was suffering from bow legs since birth and hence was finding it difficult to concentrate on her studies. With the help of ‘Margadarshi’ she was operated by Dr. Sreenivasan and she was able to walk in a period of 10 months. Two wellwishers pitched in and helped in collecting nearly a lakh needed for the operation. Ranjitha has now completed the X standard with good grades and has joined I year Diploma in Computer Science. Her father a driver in a private Company had lost his job and the family was undergoing great difficulties. Her younger sister Sujitha (name changed) had to discontinue her studies in the VII standard as her father was unable to pay the fees. Pravin Lal, a marketing professional stepped into help her in her studies and since then is supporting her. She is now in I p.u.c. with commerce as her option. The whole family is now in a better position because of Ranjitha’s operation. Her mother who had to attend to her all the time, found sufficient free time now that her daughter was back on her feet. So she too took up a job and is also supporting the family.</p>
<p>Namitha (name changed) a brilliant final year of Electronics & communication student of B.E was in a fix, when suddenly just before the final semester exams her father suffered business losses and was unable to pay her fees. She was on verge of missing out on a year of studies. A well-wisher of this trust ,Ramu Srivasatva stepped in and paid a substantial part of her fees of Rs 28,000 pa. She has now completed her B.E with distinction and has landed a good and well-paying job. She has promised to support the trust too</p>
<p>Another girl Navya (name changed) was on the verge of discontinuing her studies after I P.U commerce due to financial constraints. She was supported by the trust on time and she passed out of II PU and is now pursuing I B.Com in a reputed collage and doing well in her studies.</p>
<p>Kamala (name changed) a domestic maid was in financial distress as she was single had to support her two children in their education though they were studying in the evening college. We placed the two children in different offices and they became not only self sufficient to pursue their education, but also were able to support their mother. The family is now in a better position.</p>
<p>The trust also helped II P.U students by paying fees for the tutorials. The trust also helped some others by sending them to free coaching by approaching a few teachers who were known to the trust.</p>
<p>Apart from this we have also helped a few poor women in opening bank accounts to save their money and helped their children to get jobs in schools, office etc.</p>
