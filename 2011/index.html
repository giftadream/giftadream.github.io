			<p>A get together of the committee members, donors, beneficiaries and well wishers of Gift A Dream foundation was held on 5th December 2010 at Sarkari Vidya Mandir, Padmanabhanagar a school for which the trust gifted some sports items as per their requirement. The program was an informal one. It began at 11 AM and concluded at 1.00 PM followed by lunch. The committee members introduced themselves and explained about the objectives of the Trust. Then the donors, beneficiaries and well wishers also introduced themselves. The donors and well wishers promised their continued support to the trust. The students while introducing themselves also shared their ambitions with the group. Some of them exhibited their talent by singing songs and drawing pictures on the board. The committee had also brought some gifts to the students. One donor gifted the girl students with warm clothing and hand bags. Later the group mingled freely and exchanged ideas. It was thus an eventful day for GIFT A DREAM FOUNDATION.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Gift A Dream Foundation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Annual Get Together held on 17<sup>th</sup> November 2012 – A Birds’ View</strong></p>
<p>The Gift a Dream Foundation annual get together was held on 17<sup>th</sup> November at  the Carmel school premises, Padmanabhanagar.  We wish to express our gratitude to Mr.Kudroli, Chairman – Carmel school, who in addition to being a donor,  has always whole heartedly supported the foundation’s activities.</p>
<p>The innovation in this year’s get together was that it was conducted by students who have been supported by the foundation. The program began with a Kannada song by Chaitra (II year BE) followed by Harish (II year PUC) welcoming the invitees. The trustees detailed the activities of the trust over the year 2011-12 and the future plans of foundation were laid forward. <strong>The detailed activities undertaken by the trust have been already been documented and updated on the website.</strong></p>
<p>The experience of the volunteer program being run from Vinayaka School was shared by Ms.Anuradha (Volunteer –Teacher). The program has been running for two years now, mainly due to the untiring efforts of the volunteer team.  The efforts of the team have been well appreciated by both the students and school authorities. The one area of concern which remains is the paucity of volunteers to teach the high school children. We wish to request more volunteers in teaching English and other subjects to High school children. Interested people can contact Ms.Meera Mukund .</p>
<p>The experiences with the foundation of both donors and parents were shared with the audience. The foundation’s support and activities have begun to make a very meaningful impact in the participant’s lives, in its own small but powerful way. Some of the senior college-going students also spoke about the help extended to them by the foundation. All of the college-going students have now become quite involved with the activities of the foundation and have planned to be involved with it on a long term basis.</p>
<p>Further, the activities of the foundation in the Tribal districts of Chamarajanagar were shared by Mr.Parshivamurthy from the ‘<em>Jana Spandana’</em> trust. The interventions in three schools in the district have been positive, and the activities of the foundation in this area are now geared for further expansion.</p>
<p>All the children who attended the annual get together were overjoyed to receive the gifts presented to them by the foundation on this occasion.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a group activity conducted by Ms.Nandini. This activity aimed to ensure that children and the donors get an informal opportunity to interact with each other. This activity was quite popular among the audience.</p>
<p>With its many firsts, this year’s get together was a huge success. We wish for another very successful year for the foundation with the support of all our participants & well wishers.</p>
