			<p>The new academic year 2012-13 has started, and students are enthusiastically marching ahead. Let’s have a bird’s view of the year (2011-12) that was.</p>
<p>At the outset, we thank all our donors who have supported our cause of supporting children in their education.<br>
Special thanks are due to</p>
<ul><li><strong>A donor</strong> who has generously donated 2.3 lakh  2010-2011 for the academic year 2011-12 and Rs 5.3 lakhs for the academic year 2012-2013.</li>
<li><strong>A donor</strong> who has recognized our work & increased her donation to Rs.50,000.00. She now not only supports a student but also has donated to the general pool,</li>
<li><strong>A donor</strong> who has increased her donation to Rs.40,000.00.</li>
<li><strong>A donor</strong> for generously providing place for our get together and hosting it too.He has also promised support to our cause every year.</li>
<li><strong>Our volunteers</strong> taught English to a group of IX std students throughout the year on all  Saturdays as part of a programme to improve their soft skills. An evaluation was conducted by the year end and the toppers were given awards.</li>
</ul><p>Books and educational kits were distributed to 1200 students in the remote villages of   Masarapadi,-Hosahalli, Siddanakunte, Kodigerahalli, Kalenahalli, Maidinahalli etc., in Madhugiri Taluk.  A science exhibition was conducted there in Dec 2011 and was sponsored by us in association with chaitanya sinchana trust.</p>
<p>4 students supported by us from past 4 years have successfully completed their B. Com degree in 1st & 2nd class. They intend to take up jobs.</p>
<h2>Our Future Plans</h2>
<p>We plan to support the students of tribal/rural villages residing in B.R. Hills. We have made a couple of visits and surveyed the area. The Ashrama schools come under the Child Welfare Department who have provided them with a good building and infrastructure but there are gaps in the academic aspects. We plan to chip in there and provide the students with study material and reference books for the library, educational charts to the students, in addition to providing foot wear for both daily wear and sports .</p>
<p>We are also looking for some donors who can donate a couple of computers. This is needed by an NGO Spandana who give free Computer Training to X passed tribal students in B R Hills area.</p>
<p>We have distributed note books to children of Government Schools in Madhugiri Taluk of Tumkur District. Last year we covered seven schools and this year we have covered 15 schools.</p>
<p>We have received a request from a few schools in Chikkaballapur to provide them with note books. We plan to visit them in the near future and provide the necessary assistance.</p>
<p>We plan to have a youth wing this year by inviting our students above 16 years to volunteer to teach, organise and conduct our get together etc. This is a part of our efforts to empower the youth.</p>
<p>We hope to continue our efforts to support more schools and children. All this will be possible with your active participation and cooperation.</p>
